# Heart Failure Prediction

We aim to develop an innovative heart failure prediction system that utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze a comprehensive set of patient data. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, we seek to identify crucial risk factors and potential indicators of heart failure, ultimately improving patient outcomes and saving lives.
